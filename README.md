Build a CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset by applying few regularization techniques like drop out and data augmentation
CIFAR is an acronym that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and the CIFAR-10 dataset was developed along with the CIFAR-100 dataset by researchers at the CIFAR institute.
The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32Ã—32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes, such as frogs, birds, cats, ships, etc. The class labels and their standard associated integer values are listed below.
